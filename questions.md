#### I did not consider between days time windows to make it simpler.

#### I found that every year start and end is holiday, so for considering the day before holiday as a free day, we should not mention the next year

#### we can change the amounts for congestion tax in application.yml file but for more dynamic configuration I should use database.

#### I should write some proper tests and dockerized my code

#### I can do some Improvements for dockerization and controller advice
